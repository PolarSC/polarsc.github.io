---

It seems like every soccer league is broadcast on a different channel / streaming service. It's difficult to keep track of it all.
​
BUT NOT ANYMORE!
​
We've compiled a chart showing which services broadcast popular men's and women's leagues for Canadian audiences. Discover how to watch European and North American leagues and international tournaments, including several Canadian leagues such as League1 BC and U Sports. You can also see streams' broadcast languages, and which streams are free. Check it out, and click on streams' logos to find details about their coverage (just because there's a checkmark doesn't mean they carry all games for that league).
