Figuring out where to watch your favourite team or league can be tough. There are dozens of streaming services and TV channels that could be broadcasting those games. If you want to find where you can watch Canadians playing, you have to filter through that giant list. We decided to make it a bit easier for you.

There are Canadians playing all over the world in both men's and women's leagues. Many of those leagues are available via streaming services, but not all leagues are as popular as others and not all leagues have large numbers of Canadians in them.

Domestically or abroad, we have put together an infographic of the places where you can watch the top leagues that Canadians are playing in.
